This is my Emacs cheatsheet. It is quite basic for now.

* Fundamentals
** Command multipliers

| Keys                   | Action                                                                                            |
|------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C--=, =M--=           | Reverse direction of following command.                                                           |
| =C-[0-9]+=, =M-[0-9]+= | Repeat the following command n times.                                                             |
| =C-u=                  | Repeat the following command 4 times (may be followed by a number; multiplies itself if repeated) |

** Moving around

| Keys    | Command     | Unit      | Direction           |
|---------+-------------+-----------+---------------------|
| =C-f=   |             | Character | Forward             |
| =C-b=   |             | Character | Backward            |
| =M-g c= | ~goto-char~ | Character | Go to nth in buffer (???) |
| =M-f=   |             | Word      | Forward             |
| =M-b=   |             | Word      | Backward            |
| =C-n=   |             | Line      | Forward             |
| =C-p=   |             | Line      | Backward            |
| =C-a=   |             | Line      | Start               |
| =C-e=   |             | Line      | End                 |
| =M-a=   |             | Sentence  | Start               |
| =M-e=   |             | Sentence  | End                 |
| =M-<=   |             | Buffer    | Start               |
| =M->=   |             | Buffer    | End                 |
|         |             |           |                     |

** Killing and yanking

*Slang:* In Vim, /yanking/ means cut, in Emacs it means *paste*. 

** Windows and Frames

*Slang:* A /frame/ is what graphical OSes refer to as a /window/, a
/window/ is an internal Emacs frame. This is in fact surprisingly
logical: Since Emacs /is/ itself a tiling Window manager, it deals
with windows, and put them into frames. Everything is clear when you
don't forget that Emacs keeps pretending it's an OS.

** Undoing and redoing

* Vim emulation/modal editing.

Emacs is quite good at pretending to be Vim.

  * *evil* is the Extensible VI Layer for Emacs. It provides almost
    perfect Vim behavior, including ex.
  * *god-mode* is a minor-mode similar to Vim's normal mode. It allows
    to enter commands without modifier keys.

* Learning helpers

  - *discover-my-major* 
  - *guru-mode* disables arrow motions and other bad keybindings and
    prints the correct binding.


* Programming/Emacs as IDE.

  * *company* is an extensible completion framework. It can interface
    with multiple backends. It also allows to use YouCompleteMe daemon
    (ycmd).
  * *flycheck* is a framework for on-the-fly checking and/or linting
    of source code. Like company, it connects to backends which does
    the actual work, and deals with integrating them in 
  * *helm-dash* allows to browse [[https://kapeli.com/dash][Dash]] docsets directly from
    Emacs. Helm-dash extends the functionality of Helm, which is an
    excellent fuzzy finder framework.

* Writing 

** LaTeX *

    *AucTex* is likely to be the best TeX editing environment
    ever.  

** Org mode
